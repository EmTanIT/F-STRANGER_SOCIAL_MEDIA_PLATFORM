<h1> F-STRANGER - An Anounymous Chatting Platform !</h1>
This is a "<i>social platform for individuals with shared perspectives while preserving anonymity</i>".<br>

# 0. Introduction
Nowadays, adolescents tend to suffer from autism due to the development of technology. More and more people use editing software to make themselves better in the eyes of everyone, immersed in the unreal world. Forget to develop soft skills such as communication. Therefore, we have developed a system capable of real-time chatting so that people can experience it with other strangers based on realistic life.

### Notable Features:

- The system can match you with other stranger users randomly and put both in the chatting room.

- The chat room will be cancelled if one of them does not feel suitable or enjoyable with their new "friend" or maybe they feel not enough safe, they can leave anytime immediately.
